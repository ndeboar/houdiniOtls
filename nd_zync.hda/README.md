A better way to Submit to Zync from Houdini.

It 'only' supports Arnold (HtoA). That is the only renderer I use (for now). 

Features
- Submit multiple ROPs at the same time
- Uses the settings from the ROPs, no need to set frame ranges or output directories on the Zync node
- Faster, doesn't have callbacks for building the menus
- Remembers your settings from the last session
