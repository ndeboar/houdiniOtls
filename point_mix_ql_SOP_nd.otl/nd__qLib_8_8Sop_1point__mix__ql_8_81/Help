= Point Mix qL =

*Version 0.3.0*

"""Blends point attributes between two inputs by a control attribute."""

@Usage
    Connect the two geometries that you want to blend to the operator. Define a float attribute on one of the
    input geometries that will controll the mix, and set the _Control Attribute_ parameter to this. Set the _Attributes
    To Mix_ parameter to a list of attributes that you want to mix. Non-Mixed attributes will be copied verbatim from the
    first input.

@Limitations
    Currently float, vector and vector4 type attributes are supported only as mix targets. If you feed any other type to
    mix the result will be garbage at best.

@Parameters
    Group:
        The group of points the operator affects.
    Attributes To Mix:
        List of attributes to mix.
    Control Attrib:
        Name of the attribute which controls the mix.
    On:
        Get control attribute from first or second input.
    Invert:
        Invert the effect of the mix.
    Envelope:
        A global multiplier of the effect.
